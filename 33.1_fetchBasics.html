<!-- an umbrella term “AJAX” (abbreviated Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)
for network requests from JavaScript. -->

<!-- basic syntax -> fetch(url, [options]) -->

<!-- without options, it is a simple GET request, downloading the content of url 
getting a response is a 2 stage process -->

<!-- 1, the promise returned by fetch resolves with an object of built-in Response class
as soon as the serve responds with headers. -->
<!-- at this stage, we check HTTP status, the promise rejects
if the fetch was unable to make HTTP request, e.g. network problems. -->
<!-- status - HTTP status e.g. 200, 404, 500 -->
<!-- ok - boolean, true if the HTTP status code is 200 - 299.  -->

<!-- 2. to get the response body, use an addtional method call -->
<!-- 
response.text() – read the response and return as text,
response.json() – parse the response as JSON,
response.formData() – return the response as FormData object (explained in the next chapter),
response.blob() – return the response as Blob (binary data with type),
response.arrayBuffer() – return the response as ArrayBuffer (low-level representation of binary data),
additionally, response.body is a ReadableStream object, it allows you to read the body chunk-by-chunk, we’ll see an example later.
-->
<!-- we can choose only one body-reading method.
if we have already used response.text(), we can't use response.json() because body content has already been processed. -->
